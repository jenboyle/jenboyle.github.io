        Improvising on bass is hard. I find there are a lot of factors to think
        of, e.g drum ü•Å, guitar chords üé∏, chord progressions <em>I VI V IV</em>
        , rhythm üé∂, groove, key üîë, the list goes on...

        Improvising by youself or with a band are also two different scenarios.
        I do find myself for my own projects using my{" "}
        <Link to="/jam_time">jam</Link> page. I usually select a key, then a
        progression, and go to that theory page in my <Link to="/">theory</Link>
        . I then select a drum beat that suits what I have in mind on BeatBuddy
        or use my sdrum pedal and play a riff into it.

        I use <Link to="/percussion">percussion</Link> and sometimes keys or
        guitar. I have recently been learning some violin. Then I record it into
        Cubase and I try to use some of the <Link to="/cubase">cubase</Link>{" "}
        mixing and mastering tips I have learned.

        It can be daunting but my advice is to try and you might surprise
        yourself. Some of my noodles I recorded I am most happy with and I
        probably cannot replicate them! The last year I have started thinking of
        playing more conversational üó£Ô∏è and also reading about harmony and
        dissonance.
