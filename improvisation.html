    <article><p>A couple of years in to playing bass I found it hard to improvise on the spot.  I'd be lying if I said this wasn't the case anymore!  When I was jamming with people I'd look at what chords they were playing and have an idea but it was a guess.  I find when I try playing by ear I'll get a few of the chords without the help of anything like Moises Transcribe etc.  When in a band and we had a song I'd ask the chords and keep refining what I was playing until it seemed good.</p></article>

    <article><p>But that's a band scenario.  On my own, I have found if I want to improvise a few ways to do it.  I like picking a drum on BeatBuddy, then a key, then chords a pattern like 251 145.</p></article>

    <article><p>If I'm feeling adventurous, I might even play some guitar, percussion and vocal in cubase! </p></article>
    <article><p>I have an sdrum pedal also that if I have a bass riff I made up and no idea what sort of drum, I can play my riff into it and it will play something back to me. This is what I used in this track: </p>

    <article><p>I have a TR08 for something more beat-y and got a JX08 his year and they would also provide a starting point for something original.</p></article>
