    <article><p>Join me in my bass journey.  My website touches on all things bass.</p></article>
    <article><p>I have been playing bass in my spare time for a decade.  I dabbled a bit with guitar when I was a teenager <br>
      and played bass for the first time with my brother's friend's bass he borrowed for a short time.
      When he gave <br>it back I remember still playing a few bass lines like Ash Uncle Pat on the guitar.

      In 2014 when I went on a summer holiday someone was playing nirvana and bob marley and I thought when <br>
      I get home I'm going to start playing again.  But I decided to purchase a bass as I thought it'd be easier! <br>
      Then became my love for bass and I cannot set it down, my heart longs for bass.<br>
      I realise now the songs I'm drawn to have great bass lines.  Over the years I have struggled a bit with improvisation.  <br>
      I am a programmer so I always wanted to create a website to help people in their journeys so I am finally starting to create my website.

      My musical influences.  I like anything with a good bass line.  When I was younger I liked Thin Lizzy, Blur, Oasis, indie type stuff like Echo and the Bunneymen.
      I then liked Nirvana, RHCP, Rage against the machine, Radiohead, Manic Street Preachers, NOFX, more heavier Metallica, Pantera, Kyuss, Tool.  
      I started mellowing out and stopped listening to the heavier.  When I started playing bass I suppose I listened more to the songs I was learning to play.

      I also like Spanish music, Ibiza chillout type with nice guitar and bass.

      Bands.  I am not currently in a band.  I was in one serious band Les Pantalons. The songs Cold Ground, Wooden Foot, Do you Believe, Bad thoughts are the recordings I played bass in.
      We played a few gigs. We did jam again but we didn't keep it up with work commitments.
