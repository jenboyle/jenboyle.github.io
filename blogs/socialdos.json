I moved the majority of my videos to only me or friends only. I can't even pinpoint what it is, just an accumulation of stuff. I thought I'll just get better and join some courses. So I start some technique stuff on slapping as part of that, then I start sounding like an absolute newbie at slapping so my paranoia explodes!"

But it is nice having a musical outlet when not in an active band so I decide I shouldn't be so drastic just yet. The things I can think of right now why I came to feeling like this.  Obviously there's comparison with the masters firing out content like tomorrow isn't coming and people only playing a short while. I couldn't hear anybody's mistakes in their playing only my own.  A couple of comments that were maybe meant to be insults - backhanded compliments. People who view your page but it's so crap there's nothing worth liking?"

        "para": "Doing duets fueled my paranoia, I just thought what if people only said they liked it as they felt they had to say something.  And I felt maybe I cramped people's style.  Really felt like a kind of üç∫ beer fear situation!  After some of those I really felt uncomfortable and lost confidence.  I see it in others too to get so many likes but one comment bugs them. I get it. It's pouring a lot of time into your music hobby then putting it on social where it's vulnerable for anyone to write nasty comments. Then the bad comments feed into the part of you that doubts yourself."
