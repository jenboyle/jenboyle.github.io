  "para1": "I began with a bass combo amp but I'm now a fan of amp head and speaker. I like the fact you could carry just the amp head to a gig though I haven't done this yet, I have in the past had to bring a big combo amp to a gig or two. Also over the years a few different amp heads would take up less space than a few combo amps!",

  "para2": "I have a Markbass Nano 300 Bass Amp Head and an orange speaker cab. I began with a TC Electronic BH250 bass amp head. I was drawn to the tuner on the amp as the combo I have had a tuner but I barely used the tuner on the amp head, it was nice to have as a backup.  I didn't use the tone prints either as I have a load of pedals.  I liked the mute button on the TC, but I feel the markbass was an upgrade for tone even though this one didn't have the features of mute button and tuner.",
  "para3": "When I first started looking at this setup I didn't understand about the ohms but it's pretty easy actually. My Speaker I got second hand but brilliant condition OBC112 bass cab - so it's 8 ohm.  So I think that means for the TC you get half the power so 250 watts to 125 watts. And for the Markbass 150 watts.",
  "para4": "Then with the change to speakers you need speakon cables. I rarely use my combo amp anymore but I guess I didn't sell it in case I get an issue with my speaker or amp. "
