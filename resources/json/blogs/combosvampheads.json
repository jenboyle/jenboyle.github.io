  "para1": "I began with bass combo amp but I'm now a fan of amp head and speaker. I like the fact you could carry just the amp head to a gig though I haven't done this yet, I have in the past had to bring a big combo amp to a gig or two. Also over years a few different amp heads would take up less space than a few combo amps!",
  "para2": "I have a TC Electronic BH250 Bass Amp Head and an orange speaker cab. I was drawn to the tuner on the amp as the combo I have had a tuner but I barely use the tuner on the amp head, it is nice to have as a backup.  I don't use the tone prints either as I have a load of pedals.  I like the mute button.",
  "para3": "When I first started looking at this setup I didn't understand about the ohms but it's pretty easy actually. This amp head needs minimum 4ohm load. My Speaker I got second hand but brilliant condition OBC112 bass cab - so it's 8 ohm.  So I think that means get half the power so 250 watts to 125 watts.",
  "para4": "Then with the change to speakers you probably need speakon cables."
