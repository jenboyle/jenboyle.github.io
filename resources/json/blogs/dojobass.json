  "para1": "Nope I'm not talking about Javascript 0x1F60B! I joined Bubby Lewis' patreon last month (Bubby's Dojo) and it has improved my mood on my bass journey. I've started dabbling in soloing and trying to get my voice 0x1F5E3 on the bass. ",
  "para2": "I also am starting to learn my modes, I was really liking lydian and made a little jam that to me sounded a little like it belonged in Mario 0x1F478! I put that on my public Insta. I restarted my SBL technique course. ",
  "para3": "I am starting to link up theory options under my bass theory and my intention was to learn as I code it which I think seems to be what's happening so that's a win. ",
  "para4": "My two fav pedals this month are definitely the discumbobulator and space echo 0x1F30C. I must add these to my gear section. Maybe I have become a bit effect heavy lately, it's a lot of fun. 0x1F61C",
  "para5": "In work I have started AI, I'm a little intrigued now to maybe try some on my website. "
