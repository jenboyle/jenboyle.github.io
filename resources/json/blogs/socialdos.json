  "para1": "Yea my last blog was a little naive. A while of posting on social media has now got me in a nervous mess. In the words of Radiohead - I lost myself. I moved the majority of my videos to only me or friends only. I can't even pinpoint what it is, just an accumulation of stuff. I thought I'll just get better and join some courses. So I start some technique stuff on slapping as part of that, then I start sounding like an absolute newbie at slapping so my paranoia explodes!",
  "para2": "TBH I think if it's getting me this annoyed I should just delete right? But it is nice having a musical outlet when not in an active band so I decide I shouldn't be so drastic just yet. The things I can think of right now why I came to feeling like this.  Obviously there's comparison with the masters firing out content like tomorrow isn't coming and people only playing a short while. I couldn't hear anybody's mistakes in their playing only my own.  A couple of comments that were maybe meant to be insults - backhanded compliments. People who view your page but it's so crap there's nothing worth liking?",
  "para3": "I see it in others too to get so many likes but one comment bugs them. I get it. It's pouring a lot of time into your music hobby then putting it on social where it's vulnerable for anyone to write nasty comments. Then the bad comments feed into the part of you that doubts yourself.",
  "para4": "I think I've covered some reasons and there's more but I can't think of it all right now. It's been a very grinchy month for me, I just wasn't feeling at all Christmassy and then I get a sick bug 0x1F922 on xmas day. And I wasn't well on my birthday too 0x1F973",
  "para5": "Hopefully I can get over these insecurities and enjoy posting again I'm not sure.  IRL I think I just need to join a band. 0x1F3B8 0x1F941"
